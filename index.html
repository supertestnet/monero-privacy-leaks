            <h1>List of leaks</h1>
            <hr>
            <h2>Leaks involving receiver privacy</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Monero only works if the receiver provides the sender with a monero address -- thus leaking it to the sender</li>
                <li>Every monero transaction leaks one of the receiver's stealth public keys to the sender</li>
                <li>Every monero transaction provides cryptographic proof to the sender linking the recipient's stealth public key to their original monero address</li>
                <li>Every monero transaction leaks the amount received by the recipient to the sender</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            <h2>Leaks involving sender privacy</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Every monero transaction leaks at least one of the sender's inputs -- these can sometimes be linked to the sender's real identity via the common input ownership heuristic</li>
                <li>Every monero transaction leaks at least one of the sender's ring signatures, and each of those references 16 stealth public keys. 15 are "decoys" and one is the real stealth public key where the sender received the money he or she is now sending, and chain analysts have tools for eliminating decoys by e.g. checking if any of them belongs to themselves or one of their partners, which they can then rule out as definitely not the true spender (because they know they themselves didn't sign the transaction, and can ask their partners if they did). By ruling out many decoys as definitely not the true spender, they can sometimes even narrow it down to just one pubkey and thus know for sure which stealth public key in the ring signature is the true spender</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Leaks involving amount privacy</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Every monero transaction leaks the fee paid by the sender -- these fees are sometimes used for wallet fingerprinting, e.g. commonly used services like exchanges, darknet markets, and custodial wallets tend to set higher fees than do users of self-custodial wallets</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            <h2>Common UX hurdles in monero</h2>
            <p>These hurdles make it hard to use monero privately</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Many monero wallets share the user's "view key" with a server so that it can scan the blockchain in the background for any stealth public keys belonging to the user and tell them how much money they contain, which speeds up wallet functions at the expense of user privacy</li>
                <li>Many monero wallets connect to monero nodes via an RPC connection in order to broadcast transactions, thus leaking their user's ip address to whatever nodes they connect to. These RPC connections bypass the Dandelion upgrade that is supposed to protect the sender's ip address</li>
                <li>Many monero users reuse their monero address by e.g. providing it to multiple exchanges. But address reuse is bad for privacy because it allows multiple senders to easily "compare notes" and see if they sent money to the same person, and it allows the same person to more easily log whether they sent money to the same person more than once</li>
                <li>It is difficult to safely "rotate keys" in monero -- and delete your old private keys -- because monero wallets commonly support a "contact list" which works by directly storing the recipient's monero address for future reuse. So if you do delete your private keys, someone might send money to a monero address whose key you deleted. But rotating keys is wise because, in monero, your private keys are cryptographically linked to their whole transaction history, which can be looked up on the blockchain by anyone who acquires those keys. Rotating keys (and safely deleting the old ones) is thus wise but hard to do in monero, and that's a serious UX hurdle</li>
            </ul>

It did not use the info about the target's stealth public keys, their ring signatures, or their fee data. The report argued that the time and amounts in the analyzed transactions demonstrated that the target did the following procedure several times: the target swapped criminal proceeds into monero via a no-KYC exchange, withdrew them to a monero wallet, and then, within minutes, sent similar amounts -- sometimes identical amounts -- to a KYC exchange, where they sold the monero for fiat currency. The KYC exchange had the target's KYC info, which is how the authorities nabbed him.</p>

                <p><span class="bold">Attack type</span>: Eve-Alice-Eve attack with poisoned outputs and RPC connections</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Data leaked by the target</span>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In several transactions, monero leaked the amount received by the target (Alice) to the attacker (Eve)</li>

                    <li>In several transactions, monero leaked the time of the target (Alice)'s "send" transactions to the attacker (Eve)</li>

                    <li>In several transactions, monero leaked the fee paid by the target (Alice) in their "send" transactions to the attacker (Eve)</li>
                    <li>In several transactions, the target's wallet leaked that it was a "light" wallet by using RPC connections to various monero nodes to broadcast its transactions</li>
                    <li>In one transaction, the target's wallet leaked the user's ip address while connecting to a monero node via an RPC connection</li>
                </ul>
                <p><span class="bold">Data used by the attacker</span>: The attacker's report used all of the above-listed leaks except for the fee data. (Although they did not use the fee data, they mentioned that it is sometimes useful for fingerprinting wallets, e.g. they mentioned that widely-used services like exchanges, darknet markets, and custodial wallets tend to set larger fees than do users of self-custodial wallets.) The target's use of a RPC connections was particularly meaningful because the target eventually revealed their ip address when their wallet connected to one of the attacker's nodes to broadcast a transaction, and the attacker was then able to use that ip address to find the target's real identity. To ensure that this transaction was created by the target, however, they had to do the following analysis: in several transactions, the attacker successfully used off-chain data about the "decoy" public keys in the ring signatures to eliminate some decoys, and at least once they identified the target as the true spend. They used these transaction analysis techniques several times, looking for transactions where the target connected to one of the attacker's nodes to broadcast a transaction via an RPC connection. The attacker found several transactions that did this, most of which could not be used to identify the recipient because he used a VPN to guard his ip address. But in one of them, he did not use a vpn, so they found his ip address and nabbed him. The only thing the attackers used timing analysis for, in this case, was to identify which transactions were sent before and after the Dandelion upgrade in monero, which makes it harder to identify the ip addresses of monero senders who use their own nodes.</p>

            <h2>3. A Finnish ransomware operator</h2>
            <p>
                Finnish authorities say they traced a ransomware operator’s monero from a swap service to a monero wallet to binance. The description of the case makes it sound like they used poisoned outputs, but there is evidence that the perpetrator leaked his monero private keys shortly before his arrest, which would have enabled a simpler attack: simply look up his transaction history on the blockchain. <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/finnish-authorities-traced-monero-vastaamo-hack" target="_blank">source</a> - January 2024

                <p><span class="bold">Data used by the attacker</span>: It depends on which attack the attacker used, which is not clear from the report. Since the target leaked their private keys, the easiest attack would be to look up their transaction history. However, their description of the attack sounds like a case of poisoned outputs. If that is what it was, then the attacker likely used the same data in the Incognito Market report but without the timing info, which they probably substituted with stealth address data as in the Chainalysis report.</p>
