            <hr>
            <h2>Leaks involving receiver privacy</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Monero transactions typically start after the receiver gives the sender a monero address -- thus leaking it to him or her</li>
                <li>Every monero transaction leaks one of the receiver's stealth public keys to the sender</li>
                <li>Every monero transaction provides cryptographic proof to the sender linking the recipient's stealth public key to their original monero address</li>
                <li>Every monero transaction leaks the amount received by the recipient to the sender</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            <h2>Leaks involving sender privacy</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Every monero transaction leaks at least one of the sender's inputs -- these can sometimes be linked to the sender's real identity via the common input ownership heuristic</li>
                <li>Every monero transaction leaks at least one of the sender's ring signatures, and each of those references 16 stealth public keys. 15 are "decoys" and one is the real stealth public key where the sender received the money he or she is now sending. This is bad for privacy because chain analysts have tools for eliminating decoys. For example, they can check if any of the stealth public keys in the ring signature belongs to themselves or one of their partners, and then rule it out as definitely not the true spender because they know they themselves didn't sign the transaction, and can ask their partners if they did. By ruling out many decoys as definitely not the true spender, they can sometimes even narrow it down to just one pubkey and thus know for sure which stealth public key in the ring signature belongs to the true spender</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            <h2>Leaks involving amount privacy</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Every monero transaction leaks the fee paid by the sender. These fees are sometimes used for wallet fingerprinting. For example, commonly used services like exchanges, darknet markets, and custodial wallets tend to set higher fees than do users of self-custodial wallets</li>
                <li>I already mentioned the following leak under "Leaks involving receiver privacy" but it's also an amount privacy leak so I'll just repeat it: Every monero transaction leaks the amount received by the recipient to the sender</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            <h2>Common UX hurdles in monero</h2>
            <p>These hurdles make it hard to use monero privately</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Many monero wallets share the user's "view key" with a server so that it can scan the blockchain in the background for any stealth public keys belonging to the user and tell them to look up how much money they contain, which speeds up wallet functions at the expense of user privacy</li>
                <li>Many monero wallets connect to monero nodes via an RPC connection in order to broadcast transactions, thus leaking their user's ip address to whatever nodes they connect to. These RPC connections bypass the Dandelion upgrade that is supposed to protect the sender's ip address, so privacy-conscious users of a monero wallet that leaks data in this way ought to take other measures to protect their ip address, like using a vpn or tor</li>
                <li>Even wallets that *do* use dandelion still leak data; the dandelion protocol uses "stem nodes" to forward a transaction a number of hops before broadcasting it, but each "stem node" knows that the stem node before them has some probability of being the true sender. Moreover, dandelion does not encrypt these transactions, allowing stem nodes to compare them and learn more info. For example, suppose Alice forwards 5 transactions through Bob, and Bob observes that 3 of them have multiple inputs and multiple outputs. This indicates that those 3 were made by a service with several users; and if Bob observes that Alice's node is frequently offline, that suggests Alice's node did not create those transactions, because such services typically have high uptime</li>
                <li>Many monero users reuse their monero address by e.g. providing it to multiple exchanges. But address reuse is bad for privacy because it allows multiple senders to easily "compare notes" and see if they sent money to the same person, and it allows the same sender to more easily log whether they sent money to the same person more than once</li>
                <li>It is difficult to safely "rotate keys" in monero -- and delete your old private keys -- because monero wallets commonly support a "contact list" which works by directly storing the recipient's monero address for future reuse. So if you do delete your private keys, someone might send money to a monero address whose key you deleted. But rotating keys is wise because, in monero, your private keys are cryptographically linked to their whole transaction history, which can be looked up on the blockchain by anyone who acquires those keys. Rotating keys (and safely deleting the old ones) is thus wise but hard to do in monero, and that's a serious UX hurdle</li>

                The following is a list of attacks used to trace monero. You can get further details about each attack, how it works, and where it's been used by clicking them.

            </ul>
            <h2 id="eve_alice_eve_attack">Eve-Alice-Eve attack</h2>
            <p>
                In this attack, two parties collude to deanonymize two transactions of a central figure, Alice. The first party (Eve1) sends monero to Alice in transaction A; the second party (Eve2) receives monero from Alice in transaction B.
            </p>
            <p>
                They are both called Eve because they are really the same party, in this sense: as part of the attack, they collude with one another and compare the transaction records in their wallets. If the public key Eve1 sent monero to in tx A appears in the ring signature of tx B, where Eve2 received monero, or if the amount in tx B matches the amount in tx A, or if the transaction times match (see Timing Analysis below), it is evidence that Alice received monero in tx A and sent monero in tx B.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thus the attackers trace the monero across two transactions. The evidence established in an Eve-Alice-Eve attack becomes stronger if the attackers are able to use it repeatedly against the same target. If the target's pubkey keeps showing up in the ring signature of tx B, the likelihood of it being due to chance falls lower and lower.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Eve-Alice-Eve attack was used to arrest or convict monero users in the following criminal cases, which you can read about in <a href="#case_studies" class="case_studies_link">the Case Studies section</a> of this website:

                <li>A Columbian drug dealer</li>
                <li>A Finnish blackmailer</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            <h2 id="poisoned_output_attack">Poisoned output attack</h2>
            <p>
                This attack is a digital form of the "marked bills" attack commonly used to trace physical currency. It is typically part of an Eve-Alice-Eve attack, specifically the part where Eve1 sends monero to Alice. The monero is treated as equivalent to a marked bill, where the mark is sometimes a unique amount and sometimes just a record of which pubkey received the monero (sometimes both pieces of data are treated as marks).
            </p>
            <p>
                As with physical currency, the goal is to get the "marked bills" (the poisoned outputs) to a target and then watch to see if the target sends it to a person or company -- a "colluder" -- who knows the identity of those who send them monero, and who has agreed to share data with the attacker to help identify the target.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a marked output gets sent to the colluder (i.e. the transaction sends the marked amount or uses the marked pubkey in its ring signature), the attack has worked, and the colluder can tell the attacker the identity of the sender, against whom there is now evidence that they received the poisoned output. Repeated successful use of the poisoned output attack strengthens the case against the target.
            </p>
            <p>
                The poisoned output attack was used to arrest or convict monero users in the following criminal cases, which you can read about in <a href="#case_studies" class="case_studies_link">the Case Studies section</a> of this website:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A Columbian drug dealer</li>
                <li>A Finnish blackmailer</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            <h2 id="timing_analysis_attack">Timing analysis attack</h2>
            <p>
                This attack is typically part of an Eve-Alice-Even attack. It can be used when the target tries to evade the poisoned output attack (see above), which is commonly done via two methods: churning (i.e. the target repeatedly sends the marked bills to new, fresh pubkeys to get it out of any potentially-marked pubkeys) and amount splitting (i.e. the target splits up the monero and sends chunks of it to different wallets so that no chunk matches the marked amount). If the target uses those techniques, they can still sometimes be traced by timing analysis, which is based on patterned behavior, or habits.
            </p>
            <p>
                Suppose the attacker suspects he knows the identity of his target, but has no proof. The target can send monero to the target (Alice) as Eve1 -- this is tx A -- and observe how long it takes for Alice to make a new deposit -- tx B -- to Eve2 (e.g. an exchange or merchant who shares information about its customers with the attacker). Even if the target used churning and amount splitting so that the amount and pubkey in tx B no longer match the ones the attacker marked in tx A, the attacker can still mark the time between tx A and tx B, and then try the attack again: send monero to Alice as Eve1 and mark how long it takes for Alice to make a new deposit to Eve2. Then do it again, and again, and again.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the marked "time" shows up repeatedly as roughly the same in each case, it is evidence that Alice is in some sort of habit of receiving monero, spending a certain amount of time churning it and/or splitting the amount, and then sending it to Eve2. Perhaps she set up a computer program to do this on a schedule, or she herself does it on a schedule, e.g. every Tuesday.
            </p>
            <p>
                The timing analysis attack was used to arrest or convict monero users in the following criminal cases, which you can read about in <a href="#case_studies" class="case_studies_link">the Case Studies section</a> of this website:
            </p>
            <ul>

            </ul>
            <hr>
            <h2 id="decoy_elimination_attack">Decoy elimination attack</h2>
            <p>
                This attack is useful in any case where the attacker has a list of transaction ids where they suspect their target sent monero. They can get such a list by scanning the blockchain for transactions containing a stealth pubkey known to belong to the target, or from someone who interacted with the target several times, such as an exchange or a merchant.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the list in hand, the attacker can use the transaction ids to get the relevant transactions from the blockchain, examine the ring signature(s) in each transaction, and check if any of the pubkeys in the ring signature belong to themselves or someone they know. If they find such pubkeys, they can ask the owner if they created that transaction. If not, they know it was a decoy pubkey, and not the true spender.
            </p>
            <p>
                This technique allows the attacker to reduce the target's "anonymity set." In the worst case, they can eliminate all decoys and uniquely identify the target's pubkey as the true sender of that transaction, which allows the attacker to then trace the attack backward or possibly forward to another transaction, where they may be able to use the same technique again, or another one, to continue the trace.
            </p>
            <p>
                The decoy elimination attack was used to arrest or convict monero users in the following criminal cases, which you can read about in <a href="#case_studies" class="case_studies_link">the Case Studies section</a> of this website:

            </ul>
            <hr>
            <h2 id="spy_node_attack">Spy node attack</h2>
            <p>
                This attack relies on the way monero wallets broadcast transactions to the network. Monero "light wallets" pick a node on the monero network and broadcast transactions through it using an RPC command, i.e. a software API. Some wallets pick "spy nodes" which are run by blockchain analytics companies or other attackers, who run them with the direct purpose of gather transaction data, analyzing it, and identifying user information.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a result, a user of a wallet that sends some or all transactions through these spy nodes has some probability of leaking his or her IP address to those attackers in a way that links it to a particular transaction. If an attacker gets your IP address, they can often use it to identify what city you are in, and then contact internet service providers in that city to ask them if the IP address was assigned to any of their customers. If so, they can often get the target's billing information from that internet service provider, and thus link a monero transaction directly to a user's real identity.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is worth noting that this attack only applies to "light" monero wallets. Monero nodes do a better job of protecting the IP addresses of their users, though the technique they use is not foolproof either. Monero nodes use a protocol called Dandelion++ to protect the IP addresses of their users, and in that protocol, transactions are sent through a series of "stem nodes" before one of them finally broadcasts the transaction to the whole network.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal of this "stem phase" is to avoid leaking the sender's IP address to the attacker, who is assumed to run a spy node. When Dandelion++ is used instead of an RPC command, a monero node that receives a transaction does not know if the node they received it from is the sender or just another stem node.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, the Dandelion++ protocol has weaknesses, including that is based on probability: a node has a certain percentage chance it will act as a stem node and forward the transaction to just one peer. The rest of the time, it acts as a "fluff node" and broadcasts the transaction to all of its peers.
            </p>
            <p>
                An attacker can exploit this: when he receives a transaction from a peer, he can query other nodes for the transaction id to "find out" if the previous node was in the stem phase or the fluff phase. If, after a delay, no one has the transaction, the attacker knows the transaction is likely still in its "stem phase." That information allows for further analysis: if we are still in the stem phase, then the prior node was definitely not a fluff node. It was either a stem node or the sender, which is data the attacker should not have.
            </p>
            <p>
                This attack gets better if the transaction passes through *multiple* nodes owned by the attacker or its data-sharing partners during its stem phase. The attacker knows the probability that any node is a stem node; and it knows which peers it received transactions from; so it knows the path of stem nodes is unlikely to go beyond N nodes. The more nodes it controls on the path, the more likely it is that the first node it received the transaction from is the true spender, thus leaking their IP address, and possibly linking their real identity to their monero transaction.

                This attack comes into play if a target leaks his monero private key to an attacker, e.g. because the attacker seizes a computer holding that private key in some sort of raid. In monero, your private keys are cryptographically linked to your whole transaction history, so if someone accesses your keys, they can look up your transaction history on the blockchain, and identify transactions where anyone sent you monero.

It did not use the info about the target's stealth public keys, their ring signatures, or their fee data. The report argued that the time and amounts in the analyzed transactions demonstrated that the target did the following procedure several times: the target swapped criminal proceeds into monero via a no-KYC exchange, withdrew them to a monero wallet, and then, within minutes, sent similar amounts -- sometimes identical amounts -- to a KYC exchange, where they sold the monero for fiat currency. The KYC exchange had the target's KYC info, which is how the authorities nabbed him.</p>

The target's use of a RPC connections was particularly meaningful because the target eventually revealed their ip address when their wallet connected to one of the attacker's nodes to broadcast a transaction, and the attacker was then able to use that ip address to find the target's real identity. To ensure that this transaction was created by the target, however, they had to do the following analysis: in several transactions, the attacker successfully used off-chain data about the "decoy" public keys in the ring signatures to eliminate some decoys, and at least once they identified the target as the true spend. They used these transaction analysis techniques several times, looking for transactions where the target connected to one of the attacker's nodes to broadcast a transaction via an RPC connection. The attacker found several transactions that did this, most of which could not be used to identify the recipient because he used a VPN to guard his ip address. But in one of them, he did not use a vpn, so they found his ip address and nabbed him. The only thing the attackers used timing analysis for, in this case, was to identify which transactions were sent before and after the Dandelion upgrade in monero, which makes it harder to identify the ip addresses of monero senders who use their own nodes.</p>

                <p><span class="bold">Data used by the attacker</span>: The attacker kept the majority of the report concerning their tracing techniques private, but the following information came out during live media coverage of the trial (<a href="https://www.mtvuutiset.fi/artikkeli/vastaamo-syytetyn-kuuleminen-jatkuu-karajilla-vuorossa-syyttajien-kysymykset/8862334" target="_blank">source</a>) and subsequent interviews (<a href="https://www.mtvuutiset.fi/artikkeli/vastaamo-jutussa-iso-paljastus-krp-jaljitti-jaljittamattomana-pidettya-kryptovaluuttaa/8864046" target="_blank">source</a>): the target "converted [funds] to Monero" before sending it to a "cryptocurrency account" at a regulated exchange; the conversion tool he used was a "virtual currency exchange service, where [the police] sent a request for information. This service does not require registration from its customers, nor does it collect personal data," but it "replied that the sender...[purchased] Monero virtual currency and then sent them to a private Monero wallet."</p><p>Thus the attacker colluded with a service that knew the target's monero address, his stealth public keys, the amount he received, and the time of the transaction. From there, the monero "ended up next in another virtual currency exchange service. We are talking about Binance," where the police "tried to find out the identity of the recipient with a request for information," and got his email address as a result. Thus the attacker colluded with a service that knew how much they received from the attacker and the time of his transaction sending money to them. "The timing of transfers also coincided perfectly with payments tracked by the [police]." So the attacker used the timing info in the target's transactions as part of their trace.</p><p>Moreover, the report states that "a cryptocurrency wallet [was] seized from a server related to the [crime]," and this resulted in "a supplementary investigation." This investigation uncovered that the target sent "tens of thousands of euros" to another Binance account, thus they used the amount information. The police then contacted Binance again and this time they obtained the target's "personal identification numbers."</p><p>The attacker was able to seize the target's cryptocurrency wallet due to the following mistake: "[he] accidentally uploaded the home directory of the virtual server he was using for the blackmail. ... The error occurred when the [target] attempted to schedule the automatic publication of a file containing customer data. Instead, the [software] scheduled the entire contents of [his] server to be published. A large file package was leaked onto the TOR network, containing private files from the server used in the extortion. The extortionist only realized his mistake some time later, and a large number of TOR network users managed to download parts of the file package before it was removed from the network." <a href="https://mtvuutiset.fi/artikkeli/vastaamon-jattitietomurron-esitutkinta-aineisto-julki-nain-krp-paasi-teosta-epaillyn-aleksanteri-kivimaen-jaljille/8812194" target="_blank">source</a> By leaking his private keys, it became easy for authorities to look up the target's transaction history, because it is typical for blockchain-based cryptocurrencies such as monero to provide a permanent cryptographic link between a target's private keys and the history of transactions involving those keys.</p>

            <p>
                Interpol shut down monero-only darknet market Archetyp and says they found its operators by "tracing [their] financial flows". It is not *certain* that this means they traced their monero, but it was a monero-only exchange, so monero is the only type of finances I know they had available to trace. Additionally, reports say that "assets worth EUR 7.8 million [were] seized," as well as "47 smartphones [and] 45 computers." Assuming monero was among the assets seized, the authorities can simply look up the parties' transaction history, because seizing monero typically means acquiring its private keys. <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/europe-wide-takedown-hits-longest-standing-dark-web-drug-market" target="_blank">source</a> and <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/police-seizes-archetyp-market-drug-marketplace-arrests-admin/" target="_blank">source</a> - June 2025
